*** Tuples:

Creating tuples

Tuple indexing

Tuple immutability

**Tuple methods:

1)count()

2)index()

** What I Learned

How to store multiple values using lists and tuples

How to access elements using indexing and slicing

How list methods help in modifying data

Why tuples are immutable and when to use them
